This website will serve as my personal portfolio and personal blog, in which like minded people can leave comments under posts and discuss them.

**The website is still WIP**

This git-repository is the source code of the website. Since it is still in development, many features are still missing. Following features are planned:

- a blog,
- a collection of all my finished projects,
- a newsletter,
- a comment section, powered by Disqus.
